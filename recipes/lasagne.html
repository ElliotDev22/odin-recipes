    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not. One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.</p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li> Pasta </li>
        <li> Mince Beef </li>
        <li> Carrot </li>
        <li> 1 cup tomato sauce </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li> Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese on top has browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let lasagne rest for 10 or 15 minutes at room temperature before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
